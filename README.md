# Discord Rich Presence for Processing

Show the world that you are using Processing! The Discord Rich Presence tool checks regularly on what sketch you are working and updates your Discord rich presence accordingly. Currently it shows that you are "playing" Processing, what mode (e.g. Java or p5.js) you are using and the name of the currently open sketch.

More features to come and I am also happy about pull requests ;)

*This Processing tool is currently in beta-stage. All core features are implemented, but some advanced fetaures (like preferences) are still missing. Apart from that, it is also quite new, so there could still be undiscovered bugs.*

## Supported Platforms

* Windows (32bit & 64bit Intel)
* MacOS (64bit Intel, Silicon)
* Linux (64bit Intel)

In general all plattforms that are supported by Processing and Discord should work.

## Installation

Download the latest zip-archive from [the releases page](https://github.com/letorbi/discord-rich-presence-for-processing/releases) and extract it inside the *tools* directory of your sketchbook.
