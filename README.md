# Discord Rich Presence for Processing

Show the world that you are using Processing! The Discord Rich Presence tool checks regularly on what sketch you are working and updates your Discord rich presence status accordingly. Currently it shows that you are "playing" Processing, what mode (Java, p5.js etc.) you are using.

More features to come and I am also happy about pull requests :)

## Supported Platforms

* Windows (32bit & 64bit Intel)
* MacOS (64bit Intel, Silicon)
* Linux (64bit Intel)

In general all platforms that are supported by Processing and Discord should work.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Discord Rich Presence for Processing is via the Contribution Manager (Tools > Manage Tools...). Just open the Tools tab, select the Discord Rich Presence entry from the list and click on the install button.

### Manual install

Download the latest zip-archive from [the releases page](https://github.com/letorbi/discord-rich-presence-for-processing/releases) and extract it inside the *tools* directory of your sketchbook.
